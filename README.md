## Problem Description
**Library Reservation & Review Hub**: Libraries often face challenges in efficiently managing book reservations, including handling waiting lists and ensuring fair access to resources. In addition, readers lack a centralised, visual interactive platform to share and discover book reviews, making it more difficult for them to choose their next book to read. Our project aims to address these issues by providing a streamlined book reservation system and a community review rating centre.
## Main Features
### 1. Book Reservation System
* Users can reserve currently borrowed books in advance.
* Book arrival notifications (email/SMS/app push).
* Supports reservation priority.
### 2. Waiting List Management
* Multiple users can join the waiting list for the same book.
* Automatic queuing based on reservation time ensures fairness.
* Book borrowing time limits prevent "long-term occupancy."
### 3. Community Book Review Platform
* Post a review and rating after borrowing.
* Book details page displays the overall rating and latest reviews.
* Supports likes, reports, and replies to prevent spam.
### 4. User Control Panel
* Personalized interface
* Track book reservation status (queue status, view all reserved books, etc.)
* Review history: view all published reviews
* Manage notifications, likes, replies, queues, reservations, and other information.
### 5. Search and Filter
* Advanced search function: find books by title, author, genre, or review rating.
## High‑level goals
### 1. Improve Accessibility
* Simplify the book reservation and review process for library users.
### 2. Enhance User Engagement
* Create a community-driven platform for readers to share, discover, and recommend books of interest.
### 3. Optimize Library Operations
* Streamline the book reservation process and waitlist management, reducing manual work for librarians.
### 4. Scalability
* Build a system that can support diverse resources from different libraries and a growing user base.
### 5. User-Friendly Design
* Create an intuitive and responsive interface for both desktop and mobile users.
